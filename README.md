## Description

This is an ongoing project I started while in school. As I learn other applications this page will expand along with my experiences, both in coding and in raising Hiccup!

## Setup /Installation Requirements

* There is no set up required. Simply access AnnStonely.github.io/hiccup-the-tortoise in your browser to read about how interesting life with a tortoise is.
