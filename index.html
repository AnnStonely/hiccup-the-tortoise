  <h1>Hiccup the Tortoise</h1>
  <h2>All about my pet tortoise named Hiccup!</h2>
  <!--Introduction to Hiccup-->
  <p>I have a pet tortoise. He is a male African Spurred Tortoise, also known as a Sulcata Tortoise</p>
  <p>He is very cute! I got him as a baby. He was very small and fit in the palm of my hand. Now he is way too big to fit! Sulcata Tortoises can live over 50 years!</p>
  <!--What to feed Hiccup-->
  <p>It took some time to learn how to take care of Hiccup properly. Here is a list of things he can eat:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Grass is the thing he should eat mostly.</li>
    <li>He likes many different greens. He likes turnip, collard, dandelion, and mustard greens.</li>
    <li>As a treat you can give him carrot, squash, watermelon, or other fruits and veggies.</li>
  </ul>
<!--Taking care of Hiccup-->
<p>Hiccup is very cute. That being said he is very smelly! He lives mostly in his room, going outside when it is warm and/or cool enough.</p>
<p>At least once a week I have to scrub the floors in his room. I also have to change the water in his swimming pool that is outside.</p>
<p>I had to grow grass in the desert for him. This means I have to keep it watered sometimes twice a day!</p>
<p>Hiccup is a lot of work, but, I love him so I don't mind!</p>
<!--Thank you for reading-->
<p>Getting a Sulcata is a huge commitment. I wouldn't recomment it to someone with little time.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to learn about Hiccup.</p>
